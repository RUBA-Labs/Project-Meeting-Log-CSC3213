## Agenda
- Object-Oriented Analysis and Design (OOAD) for Identifying Entities
- Discussion with Senior Batches about Past Projects
- Technical Stack Considerations and Limitations
- Review of Algorithm Suitability for Scheduling Problems
- Requirement Analysis and Functional Specifications
- Planning API Data Integration 
- UML Diagram Planning
----------


## 1. Announcements :
    - **Engaged in Object-Oriented Analysis and Design**
        - We understand who the actors in our project are and how many. How to manipulate what are the properties. How do we do better modeling? To create easy further development.
    - **Met with senior students who completed similar projects**
        -  They discuss what tech stacks they prefer, what tools they prefer, what are the. best technique, how to handle the git repository, how to create the git branches, usage to handle error, better code readability, and better collaboration with any other members.
----------
## 2. **Progress**
    - Discussion on various technology stacks used in past projects, and their advantages and limitations with senior students
    - Evaluated backend frameworks: Python Django vs. Node. js - based solutions.
    - Conducted requirement analysis and listed functional, non-functional, and pricing requirements.
    - Researched various scheduling algorithms, with Genetic Algorithm emerging as the most suitable.
    - The plane explored API integration with the art faculty IMS for data retrieval.
    - Planned the creation of UML diagrams and use case diagrams.
----------
## 3. Issues (Challenges)
    - Understanding the complexity of advanced algorithms in Python.
        - We are planning to further research to create a backend use in Python or Node.js. and also use a combination approach  
    - Ensuring effective API data integration with the existing faculty LMS.
        -  How fast is a type of operation using the API? What are the limitations?  . Because it is a third-party API we use to get data. 
    - Selecting the best algorithm for scheduling without conflict.
        - Genetic algorithm (GA) main 
        - Constraint Programming (CP)
        - Simulated Annealing
        - Tabu Search
        - Particle Swarm Optimization
        - Hybrid Algorithms (GA with CP to reduce unnecessary population generating )
----------
## 4. To-do
    - Conduct further research on alternative scheduling algorithms.
    - Finalize the list of functional and non-functional requirements.
    - Proceed with UML and use case diagram development.
    - Begin API integration testing.
    - Research Dockerization to build, run, and share containerized applications. ( Continue from last week) 
    - Create a Requirement Matrix for Documentation. ( Continue from last week )
----------
## 5. Any other 
    - Reflection:
        - Continued discussions on best practices in software design. (Continue from last week) 
        - Exploring additional features to enhance system functionality and usability.  ( Continue from last week) 
        - Schedule follow-up meetings with senior students for further insights.
        - Planning for a GitHub workflow, including branching strategies and code review process
        - Also, keep an error-free main branch in GitHub for interacting with the agile approach. Therefore, it helps to show. anytime our project progresses without errors
