## 2. Progress  

### **GitHub Repositories:**  
- [Ravindu-Sampath-Weerakoon](https://github.com/Ravindu-Sampath-Weerakoon)  
- [Geethanjana Wijesena](https://github.com/GeethanjanaWijesena)  
- [Uditha Wijethunga](https://github.com/UdithaWijethunga)  
- [Bhathiya](https://github.com/IamBhathiya)  

### **Timetable Scheduling Research:**  
- Identified key conditions for an effective timetable.  
- Discussed integration of constraints such as lecturer availability, room capacity, and course scheduling conflicts.  

### **New Feature Integration:**  

#### **Automated Exam Claim System:**  
- Designed to streamline exam payment processing.  
- Plan includes automated calculations, verification, and record-keeping.  

#### **Lab Allocation Management System:**  
- Allows students to book lab sessions based on availability.  
- Collected Faculty of Arts IT department lab details.

## 3. Issues (Challenges)  

### **Defining Constraints for Timetabling:**  
- Need precise conditions to prevent clashes between faculty, students, and rooms.  

### **API Accessibility:**  
- Awaiting confirmation on API availability and data format compatibility.  

### **Feature Expansion Considerations:**  
- Exam claims and lab allocation require additional backend development and access control mechanisms.  

---

## 4. To-Do List  
- Finalize timetable constraints and required data format.  
- Follow up on Faculty IMS API access.  
- Begin designing models for the new features.  
- Conduct feasibility analysis on automated claim processing.  
- Research existing lab booking systems for reference.  
- Add new requirements to the Requirement Matrix for documentation. (Continue from last week)  

---

## 5. Any Other Notes  
- Future meetings will focus on API integration and developing prototypes for new features.  
- The team will conduct a review after gathering timetable data to refine the scheduling algorithm.  

---

## **Reflection**  
- Understanding the manual timetable process provided valuable insights into automation constraints.  
- Faculty IMS API discussions highlighted potential integration challenges, emphasizing the need for proper maintenance.  
- Expanding the project scope to include the exam claim system and lab allocation management increases impact but introduces complexities in data handling and user access control.  
- Moving forward, we need to balance feature expansion with a structured development process to avoid delays.  
- Collaboration and clear role assignments will be crucial as we integrate these new features into the system.
